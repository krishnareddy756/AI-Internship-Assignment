GenAI Engineering Intern at VWO

We're on the lookout for a talented engineering intern for the GenAI team at VWO.

The GenAI team builds complex, smart automated systems using LLMs and agentic frameworks. This team works fast and loves to build things from the ground up. Exactly like a 0 to 1 startup.

What You'll Actually Be Doing:

You'll be right in the mix, helping us design and build these intelligent systems.
Expect to write code that we aim to review and merge quickly – sometimes even on your first day.
You’ll get access to our real production environments, not just sandboxes. 
You'll be part of the whole journey: thinking up ideas, trying them out, and then building them for real users.

We're Looking For Someone Who:

Knows their way around agentic frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, Agents SDK etc.), Python, Git, and databases (like MongoDB or Graph DB).
It’s a good plus if you've worked with queuing systems.
Has, ideally, already helped build and launch an agentic product that people are actually using.
Can explain their thoughts, ideas, or problems clearly and simply. We value clarity over complex jargon.
Likes to take ownership and see things through.
Has that "0 to 1" startup drive – excited to build new things.

What's In It For You:

A chance to work on serious production spec AI projects.
This is a 6-month paid internship. Perform well, and there’s a good chance to join our team full-time afterward.
